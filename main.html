	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1> 
	
	<p>Time complexity , is a measure of how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the input size. It helps evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of performance as data scales.</p>
	<p><strong>Space Complexity</strong> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input.</p>
